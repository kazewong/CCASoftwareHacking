CCA Software Hacker
==========================
Welcome! This is a package created out of the Astronomy Software Workshop in May 2022 at the Center for Computational Astrophysics/Math for America.
Its *primary* goal is to help us put in practice some of these software best practices and tricks we've been learning about throughout the week. 
Its *secondary* goal is to plot a Gaussian distribution.

Questions? Comments? Good! We have them too. Let's learn together!

Can we add emojis to a README?
