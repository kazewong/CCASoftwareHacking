Welcome to Alex's documentation for the Astro Software Workshop Hack Session!
========================================================================

**CCA Software Hacker** is a Python library that does something with a Gaussian distribution.
It is meant as a sandbox for playing around with some of the packages we've heard about 
from the Astro Software Workshop at CCA Flatiron in May 2022. The goal here is to end up with a 
*user-friendly* package template for future projects!

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

   This project is under active development. Please do not yell at us!
